<summary><strong>What is least sensing?</strong></summary>
<em>When conducting urban big data analysis involving personal data, a data processing entity must sense and collect only the minimum information necessary for the specified analysis purpose.</em>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How to interpret "minimum"?</strong></summary>
The first and perhaps most intuitive explanation of minimum is on the <em>data quantity</em>, i.e., sensing the smallest amount of data required for the purpose. Actually, other interpretations exist, such as <em>data precision</em>, <em>data sensitivity</em>, and <em>data predictability</em>.

**Terminology explanation:**
+ Performance-based data minimization:
+ Depth-based data minimization:
+ Breadth-based data minimization: Aims to minimize the number of features.
